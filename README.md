Mercari Price Prediction Challenge
It is a project for price prediction of Mercari's online app which is a Japanese Ecommerce company founded in February 2013 by Japanese Serial Entrepreneur Shintaro Yamada. The data for this challenge can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge/data. 
There are three datasets given for this competition. They are :-
1)	train.tsv.7z – A compressed 7z tab separated file of size 74.3 MB which when uncompressed becomes close to 329 MB.
2)	test.tsv.7z – A compressed 7z tab separated file of size 33.97 MB which when uncompressed becomes close to 150 MB.
3)	test_stg2.tsv.zip – A compressed 7z tab separated file of size 294.37 MB which when uncompressed becomes close to 736 MB.
I am not able to upload intermediate files here because of the file size. There is a .hdf5 file for the best model weights which I am not able to upload because of the size of the file.
You can download the EDA, the first cut model solutions file and the final model solution file.
